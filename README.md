# SAFE-PATH-DETECTION-VIA-CLUSTERING

Final project of Statistical Learning course discussed in September 2023.

Abstract: *Nowadays there exists a lot of navigators that guide you through the cities, using any kind
of transport means, including the walk. Most of them compute the paths basing on the time
required for the arrival, the length, the cost, the presence of traffic lights and so on. Some
of them also take into consideration the safety of the path, such as the Italian app W-her,
and thatâ€™s where our idea came from.
Our work is based on two clustering techniques, k-means++ and agglomerative clustering, to
whose resulting clusters we have assigned a hazard index that we will explain later. Using
this hazard index and the distance of each road from the clusters, we assigned a weight
to all roads and then used the weights in the calculation of the safest path between two
geographical data points.*
